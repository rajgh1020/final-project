    <h1>📜 The Story of Shadows of Shambhala</h1>

    <section id="story-box" class="fade-in">
      <p><em>“In the shadow of snow-capped Himalayan peaks, where prayer flags once fluttered in peace, darkness now lingers.”</em></p>

      <p>Centuries ago, the hidden village of <strong>Kyangjin</strong> was whispered to be near the gates of <strong>Shambhala</strong> — the legendary kingdom of enlightenment and power. Pilgrims came seeking truth. Scholars came seeking relics. But something else found its way there... something ancient and broken.</p>

      <p>One fateful winter, the skies darkened unnaturally. Villagers began to vanish. Bells once used for morning chants now rang without wind. Shadows moved where no light cast them. The temple at the heart of Kyangjin fell silent — its doors sealed, its protectors gone.</p>

      <p>Those who tried to flee were never seen again. Those who stayed... became something else.</p>

      <h2>🎴 A Forgotten Order</h2>
      <p>Legends speak of a sacred order — <strong>The Watchers of Shambhala</strong> — sworn to guard the village and maintain balance between the physical and spiritual realms. But their descendants are scattered. Their teachings lost. The gates are unguarded.</p>

      <p>Now, the veil between worlds is thin. <em>Cursed monks</em> roam the alleys. <em>Spectral beasts</em> prowl the forests. And at the center of it all, an ancient <strong>Wraith King</strong> gathers strength, preparing to breach the realm of the living.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>🔥 You Are the Last Spark</h2>
      <p>You are a descendant of the Watchers — unknowingly carrying the bloodline of the guardians.</p>

      <p>Whether you choose the path of the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🛡️ <strong>Warrior</strong>: fierce protector of the body</li>
        <li>🔮 <strong>Shaman</strong>: keeper of spirit and ritual</li>
        <li>🏹 <strong>Hunter</strong>: master of agility and survival</li>
      </ul>

      <p>...your journey begins the moment you set foot into the <strong>forest outside Kyangjin</strong>.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>🧭 Will You Survive the Shadows?</h2>
      <p>To lift the curse, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Face corrupted villagers and ancient beasts</li>
        <li>Restore sacred relics hidden in lost shrines</li>
        <li>Use your class powers wisely</li>
        <li>And ultimately enter the <strong>temple of Shambhala</strong>, where truth and horror intertwine</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="glow-text"><em>“Not all who wander in Shambhala return. But all who enter are changed.”</em></p>
